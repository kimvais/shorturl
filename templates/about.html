            <p>
                <strong>77.fi</strong> is a domain that had the sole purpose of giving me the
                shortest e-mail address possible.
                Then I realized that I can create an url-shortening service that is
                <b>guaranteed to beat tinyurl by at least 6 characters!</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                In case you need a short e-mail address (and are born in 1977, perhaps) send me an e-mail and I'll set you up with a forwarding to gmail or wherenot.</p>
